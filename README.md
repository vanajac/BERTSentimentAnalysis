# BERTSentimentAnalysis
Sentiment Analysis using pretrained BERT model

Natural language processing (NLP) is one of the most cumbersome areas of artificial intelligence when it comes to data preprocessing.
Apart from the preprocessing and tokenizing text datasets, it takes a lot of time to train successful NLP models. 

This sentiment analyzer/classifier is created using a pre-trained NLP model: BERT.
BERT takes care of all the cumbersome job of pre processing, tokenizing, etc.. 

The Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset is being used here. It consists of reviews of fine foods from Amazon.

Objective:
Given a review, determine whether the review is positive or negative.
